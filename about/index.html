    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">What is Honk?!</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout the country and across the globe, a new type of street band movement is emerging — outrageous and inclusive, brass and brash, percussive and persuasive — reclaiming public space with a sound that is in your face and out of this world! Called everything from “avant-oompah!” to a “brassroots revolution,” these bands draw inspiration from sources as diverse as Klezmer, Balkan and Romani music, Brazilian Samba, Afrobeat and Highlife, Punk, Funk, and Hip Hop, as well as the New Orleans second line tradition, and deliver it with all the passion and spirit of Mardi Gras and Carnival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acoustic and mobile, these bands play at street level, for free, with no stages to elevate them above the crowd and no sound systems or speaker columns to separate performers from participants. These bands don’t just play for the people; they play among the people and invite them to join the fun. At full power, these bands create an irresistible spectacle of creative movement and sonic self-expression directed at making the world a better place. This is the movement we call HONK!
    </p>
    <p>
      HONK! is a celebration of community, collaboration and creative expression and is dedicated to creating a community of inclusion. We work to break down systemic barriers to inclusion for those underrepresented within our community, and increase community access to our programming by producing the festival in neighborhoods of the Portland area underserved by the arts. Our interactive celebrations are designed to be accessible, with representation from a wide range of ages and abilities; offering pick-up bands throughout the festival open for anyone who would like to pick up an instrument and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      What first started in a city called Somerville, northwest of Boston, Massachusetts in 2008 has expanded to New York, Detroit, Seattle, Austin, Brazil and Australia and now in 2023 PORTLAND, OREGON!

    <ul>
      <li class="my-2">
        We seek to build a community of activist street bands that engages progressive issues through music, and spectacle, and that comes together to share knowledge and experience, and to support each other.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We believe that music in the streets helps to reclaim and redefine the use of public space.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We believe that music brings elements of power, energy, and healing to struggles for collective liberation.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We stand in solidarity with struggles that challenge all forms of individual and institutional domination, inequality, and oppression, based on class, race, gender, sexual preference, age, ethnicity, and/or ability.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Because we believe that lasting change begins at the grassroots, we prioritize democratically organized events and struggles that promote broad-based coalition and movement building, and oppose those that encourage divisiveness and disunity.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Because we believe that the capitalist drive for profit promotes wealth inequality, material waste, and human disregard, we emphasize events that are non-commercial, environmentally friendly, community-oriented, and physically accessible.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We acknowledge that the struggle for broad collective liberation begins with transforming ourselves and our own community.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We strive to build democratic leadership, particularly among populations that are and have been most directly affected by oppression and inequality. And we recognize that there is a lot of work to be done in this area.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Within our annual HONK! Festival and related events, we aspire to build a “Brave Space” – a supportive environment in which we take on controversial issues with each other, and engage in disagreement and discomfort with each other, knowing that doing so will help us build deeper and more trustful relationships.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We believe it is important to acknowledge and learn from differences which arise between our intentions and our impacts.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        We wish for HONK! to be a community in which we uplift each other, and give each other energy to continue fighting for collective liberation.
      </li>
    </ul>
